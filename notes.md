# Work notes for RBJ projects

These notes are just loose scribbles. Nice to have in git though!

##What is my bug, and what do I need to do about it? 

Ok so I made the app save the bitcoin_invoice.bitpay_id to the db. I did this in the controller. It should be done in the model, so have a look at that. But for now commit code that's crummy but working! Cheers

Have a look at models/bitcoin_invoice.rb line 17
